The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code snippet might cause unexpected layout issues due to the use of floats.  When a div is floated, it is removed from the document's flow.  This can lead to the parent container collapsing and unexpected heights.
